OpenStat
========
###About
OpenStat is an exploratory statistical software meant as a replacement for Minitab. I wrote it for [Moody's Mega Math Challenge](http://m3challenge.siam.org), after they banned all non-free statistical software. There were a couple of free and open-source alternatives (e.g. SofaSTAT and PSPP), but they either didn't have all the functionality I needed or they were very buggy and hard to use.

###Features
* Ability to import CSV files (export coming soon, along with other file types)
* Basic statistical tests (e.g. t-tests and linear regression)
* Some very nice plots (histogram, violinplot, scatterplot, etc).

###Dependencies
* [wxPython](http://wxpython.org/)
* [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [scipy](http://www.scipy.org/)
* [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
* [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [seaborn (v 0.3 or greater)](http://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/)
* [statsmodels](http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net/)
